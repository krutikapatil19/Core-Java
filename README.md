## Overview

**Coreâ€‘Java** is a collection of Java fundamentals and advanced topics designed to help learners solidify their understanding of the language. It includes handsâ€‘on examples across Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Collections, Exception Handling, Threads, File Handling, and more. This repository is suited for both beginners and intermediate learners preparing for interviews, projects, or exams.

- **JavaBasics**: Primitive types, control flow statements, loops, basic Java syntax.  
- **OOP_Basics / BasicsOOP**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction.  
- **Collections**: Java Collections Framework â€” Lists, Sets, Maps, etc.  
- **Exception Handling**: Checked vs unchecked exceptions, tryâ€‘catch blocks, custom exceptions.  
- **File Handling**: I/O operations, file reading/writing, streams.  
- **Threads**: Multithreading concepts, synchronization, concurrency basics.

## Topics Covered

Here are some of the concepts/examples youâ€™ll find:

| Topic                         | Key Concepts / Sample Tasks |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Java Basics                  | Variables, operators, conditions, loops |
| OOP Principles               | Class design, inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism |
| Collections Framework        | ArrayList, HashMap, TreeSet, iterators |
| Exception Handling           | try, catch, finally, throw/throws, custom exceptions |
| File & Stream I/O            | Reading/writing files, buffered streams, serialization |
| Multithreading & Concurrency | Threads, Runnable, synchronized, thread safety |

---

## Examples

Some sample files/tasks you might explore:

- Creating classes for realâ€‘world entities (e.g. `Person`, `Employee`) demonstrating inheritance.  
- Implementing custom comparators for sorting collections.  
- Handling I/O with `FileReader`, `BufferedWriter`.  
- Using `Thread` and `Runnable` to create concurrent tasks; simple synchronization cases.  
- Defining & throwing custom exception types.

## Setup & Usage

To run or test any part of this repository locally:

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krutikapatil19/Coreâ€‘Java.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a topic folder**  
   ```bash
   cd Coreâ€‘Java/Threads
   ```

3. **Compile Java source**  
   ```bash
   javac SomeExample.java
   ```

4. **Run the compiled class**  
   ```bash
   java SomeExample
   ```

## Coding Standards

To keep the code consistent and readable, please follow:

- Use **clear, meaningful names** for classes, methods, variables.  
- Keep methods and classes focused (one responsibility).  
- Comment nonâ€‘trivial logic.  
- Handle nulls, invalid inputs, edge cases.  
- Follow Java naming conventions: PascalCase for classes, camelCase for methods/variables.  
- Organize imports; avoid unused code.
