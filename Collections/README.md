The Java Collections Framework is a set of classes and interfaces that make it easier to store and , manipulate and process groups of objects (like lists,sets ,maps).

##Why collections ?

Arrays - fixed size, no nuilt-in methods(hard to grow , shrink)
Collections - dynamic, flexible, provide ready-made methods(search, sort, insert, delete).
